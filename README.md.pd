MoneyRate Telegram Bot

ðŸš§ This project is still under development ðŸš§

About the Project

MoneyRate is a simple Telegram bot designed to provide currency exchange rates. Currently, it supports major currencies like USD, RUB, and EUR.

How It Works

The bot will be able to:
âœ… Respond to the /start command to initialize the bot
âœ… Provide help using the /help command
âœ… Convert currencies with a command like:

100 USD to EUR

(Not functional yet! Still in development.)

Installation & Setup

python --version


2. Install the required dependencies:
